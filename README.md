## How to play

The goal of the game is to find all the pairs of the card in the grid. There are 16 hidden cards (8 pairs). By clicking on the card, the card opens and you can see the hidden icon. If you click in another card and the two cards match they remain open, else they will be hidden.The goal of the game is to remember the icons and spot them in the grid and matching the cards until you find all the pairs. The game ends once all pairs are matched.
